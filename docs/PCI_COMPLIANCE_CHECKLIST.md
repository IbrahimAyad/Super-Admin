# PCI DSS Compliance Checklist - KCT Menswear Payment System

## Executive Summary

This checklist ensures your KCT Menswear payment system meets Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements for secure payment processing. As a business processing credit card payments, compliance is mandatory and critical for customer protection and regulatory compliance.

**Current Assessment Level:** PCI DSS Level 4 (Merchant processing fewer than 20,000 e-commerce transactions annually)

## PCI DSS Requirements Overview
