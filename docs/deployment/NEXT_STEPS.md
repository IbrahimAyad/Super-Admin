## Recommended Next Action

**Connect the Financial Dashboard to real data** - This will give you immediate visibility into:

- Actual order volume  
- Pending refunds

This is partially complete and would provide the most immediate value.

## Commands to Run

### To see your current orders:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_orders, 
       SUM(total_amount)/100 as total_revenue 
FROM orders 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### To check inventory levels:
```sql
SELECT p.name, pv.sku, i.available_quantity 
FROM products p 
JOIN product_variants pv ON p.id = pv.product_id 
JOIN inventory i ON pv.id = i.variant_id 
WHERE i.available_quantity < 10;
```

### To view pending refunds:
```sql
SELECT * FROM refund_requests 
WHERE status = 'pending' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
