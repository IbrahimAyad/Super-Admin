# Current Data Status in Your Admin Panel

## âœ… **You're Using REAL Database Data!**

Based on my analysis:

### 1. **ProductManagement Component**
- âœ… Fetches from Supabase using `fetchProductsWithImages()`
- âœ… All CRUD operations use real database
- âœ… No dummy data imports

### 2. **Your Database Has:**
- Real products (Suits, Tuxedos from 2025 Collection)
- Product variants connected
- One odd "w" product (might be a test)

### 3. **What You'll See When You Log In:**
- **Products:** Your real products from database (not dummy data)
- **Orders:** Any real orders in the database
- **Customers:** Real customer records
- **Analytics:** Real tracking data
- **Inventory:** Real stock levels

## ðŸŽ¯ **To Clean Up (Optional):**

If you want to remove test data like the "w" product:

```sql
-- Delete test products
DELETE FROM products 
WHERE name = 'w' 
   OR name ILIKE '%test%' 
   OR name ILIKE '%dummy%';

-- View what you have
SELECT id, name, created_at 
FROM products 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## âœ… **Your Admin Panel Shows:**
- **REAL products** from Supabase
- **REAL orders** when they come in
- **REAL inventory** levels
- **NO dummy data** (unless it's in the database)

## ðŸš€ **Summary:**
Your admin panel is **fully connected** to real data! The dummy data from `src/data/dummyData.ts` is **NOT being used** anymore. You'll only see what's actually in your Supabase database.
