üöÄ Next Steps: Implementation Plan
Now that we have our 125 foundation questions, here's the implementation approach:
Step 1: Generate API Answers (What we'll do next)
typescript// We'll have your Knowledge API answer each question
async function generateTrainingData() {
  const categories = {
    style: styleQuestions,
    wedding: weddingQuestions,
    service: serviceQuestions,
    company: companyQuestions,
    product: productQuestions
  };
  
  const trainingData = [];
  
  for (const [category, questions] of Object.entries(categories)) {
    for (const question of questions) {
      const answer = await knowledgeAPI.generateAnswer(question, category);
      trainingData.push({
        question,
        answer,
        category,
        patterns: extractPatterns(question),
        entities: extractEntities(question)
      });
    }
  }
  
  return trainingData;
}
Step 2: Create Variation Sets
After we have the base answers, we'll generate 3-5 variations of each question to make the bot more robust:
typescriptconst variationExamples = {
  original: "What colors go well with navy blue chinos?",
  variations: [
    "What matches navy pants?",
    "Best colors to wear with dark blue chinos?",
    "Navy chinos - what should I pair them with?",
    "How do I style navy blue pants?",
    "What tops work with navy bottoms?"
  ]
};
Step 3: Pattern Extraction
We'll identify the patterns each question teaches:
typescriptconst patternMap = {
  "What colors go well with navy blue chinos?": {
    patterns: ["color_matching", "specific_item_styling"],
    entities: ["navy blue", "chinos"],
    intent: "coordination_advice",
    responseFramework: "complementary_suggestions"
  }
};
Step 4: Train & Test
Create the training pipeline that uses these Q&As to build semantic understanding.

Would you like me to:

Help you set up the code to have your API answer all 125 questions?
Create the variation generator for each question?
Build the pattern extraction system?
Design the training pipeline architecture?

Let me know which step you'd like to tackle first, and I'll provide the specific implementation code!RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.Research Opus 4
