---

## 4. Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Assessment (0-15 minutes)

#### **Initial Response Steps**
1. **Acknowledge Alert** (< 2 minutes)
   - Log incident in tracking system
   - Assign unique incident ID
   - Confirm receipt in Slack #security-incidents

2. **Initial Assessment** (< 5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Quick security health check
   curl -s https://kctmenswear.com/health | jq '.security_status'
   
   # Check recent security events
   psql -c "SELECT * FROM security_audit_log WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' ORDER BY risk_score DESC LIMIT 10;"
   
   # Verify system availability
   curl -I https://kctmenswear.com
   curl -I https://admin.kctmenswear.com
   ```

3. **Classify Incident** (< 10 minutes)
   - Determine severity level (P0-P3)
   - Assess potential impact scope
   - Identify affected systems and data

4. **Activate Response Team** (< 15 minutes)
   - Notify appropriate IRT members based on severity
   - Create incident war room (Slack/Teams channel)
   - Establish communication bridge if needed

#### **Decision Tree for Classification**

```
Is customer payment data at risk? → YES → P0
Is admin access compromised? → YES → P0/P1
Is service completely unavailable? → YES → P0
Are >100 customers affected? → YES → P1
Is there evidence of data exfiltration? → YES → P0/P1
Is there active exploitation? → YES → P1/P2
Is this reconnaissance only? → YES → P2/P3
```

### Phase 2: Containment (15 minutes - 2 hours)

#### **Immediate Containment Actions**

##### **For Payment-Related Incidents (P0)**
```bash
# Emergency payment processing shutdown
curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/disable_all \
  -u $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: \
  -d "reason=security_incident"

# Disable checkout functionality
curl -X PATCH "$SUPABASE_URL/rest/v1/settings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" \
  -d '{"checkout_enabled": false, "reason": "security_incident"}'
```

##### **For Admin Compromise (P0/P1)**
```bash
# Disable all admin sessions
psql -c "UPDATE admin_sessions SET is_active = false, terminated_reason = 'security_incident';"

# Force password reset for all admins
psql -c "UPDATE admin_users SET force_password_reset = true WHERE is_active = true;"

# Disable admin panel access
# Update Vercel environment variable
vercel env add ADMIN_PANEL_DISABLED true --scope production
```

##### **For Database Compromise (P0)**
```sql
-- Enable emergency read-only mode
ALTER SYSTEM SET default_transaction_read_only = on;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

-- Revoke write permissions from application users
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM authenticated;
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM anon;
```

##### **For DDoS/API Abuse (P1/P2)**
```bash
# Enable aggressive rate limiting
curl -X POST "$SUPABASE_URL/functions/v1/update-rate-limits" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY" \
  -d '{"mode": "emergency", "requests_per_minute": 10}'

# Block suspicious IPs via Cloudflare API
curl -X POST "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/firewall/rules" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_API_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"action": "block", "filter": {"expression": "ip.src in {192.168.1.1}"}}'
```

#### **Evidence Preservation**
```bash
# Capture system snapshot
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > "incident_${INCIDENT_ID}_db_snapshot_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql"

# Export security logs
psql -c "\COPY (SELECT * FROM security_audit_log WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours') TO 'incident_${INCIDENT_ID}_security_logs.csv' CSV HEADER;"

# Capture application logs
vercel logs --since=24h > "incident_${INCIDENT_ID}_app_logs.txt"
```

### Phase 3: Eradication (2-8 hours)

#### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Technical Investigation**
   - Review security logs and access patterns
   - Analyze affected systems and data
   - Identify attack vectors and vulnerabilities
   - Determine scope of compromise

2. **Forensic Data Collection**
   ```bash
   # Extract detailed forensic data
   psql -c "
   SELECT 
     sal.*, 
     au.email as admin_email,
     u.email as user_email
   FROM security_audit_log sal
   LEFT JOIN admin_users au ON sal.admin_user_id = au.id
   LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON sal.user_id = u.id
   WHERE sal.created_at > '$INCIDENT_START_TIME'
   ORDER BY sal.created_at DESC;
   " > forensic_analysis.txt
   ```

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Scan for similar vulnerabilities
   - Review recent code changes
   - Assess infrastructure configuration
   - Evaluate third-party dependencies

#### **Remediation Actions**

##### **Security Patches**
```bash
# Update dependencies
npm audit fix --force
npm update

# Apply emergency security patches
git apply emergency-security-patch.patch
npm run build
vercel deploy --prod

# Update database security
psql -f emergency-security-config.sql
```

##### **Access Control Hardening**
```sql
-- Revoke and recreate compromised credentials
DROP USER IF EXISTS compromised_user;
CREATE USER new_secure_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'new_secure_password';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON necessary_tables TO new_secure_user;

-- Update API keys and tokens
UPDATE system_config SET stripe_webhook_secret = 'new_webhook_secret';
UPDATE system_config SET jwt_secret = 'new_jwt_secret';
```

##### **Infrastructure Hardening**
```bash
# Rotate all secrets
vercel env rm STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
vercel env add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY $NEW_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

vercel env rm SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY  
vercel env add SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY $NEW_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

# Update firewall rules
# Block known malicious IPs
# Restrict admin access to specific IP ranges
```

### Phase 4: Recovery (4-24 hours)

#### **Service Restoration**
1. **Phased Restoration Approach**
   ```bash
   # Phase 1: Core infrastructure (0-2 hours)
   # Restore database write access
   psql -c "ALTER SYSTEM SET default_transaction_read_only = off; SELECT pg_reload_conf();"
   
   # Phase 2: User services (2-4 hours)
   # Re-enable user authentication and core features
   
   # Phase 3: Payment processing (4-8 hours)
   # Restore checkout after security validation
   
   # Phase 4: Admin functions (8-24 hours)
   # Restore admin access with enhanced security
   ```

2. **Security Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run comprehensive security scan
   npm run security:scan
   
   # Validate RLS policies
   npm run test:rls-policies
   
   # Test authentication flows
   npm run test:auth-security
   
   # Verify rate limiting
   npm run test:rate-limits
   ```

3. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   ```bash
   # Deploy enhanced monitoring
   psql -f enhanced-security-monitoring.sql
   
   # Update alert thresholds
   node scripts/update-alert-thresholds.js --mode=high-security
   
   # Activate additional logging
   vercel env add ENHANCED_LOGGING true
   ```
