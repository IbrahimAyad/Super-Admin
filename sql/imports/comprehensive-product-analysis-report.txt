RECOMMENDATIONS

4. IMAGES: Verify all image URLs are accessible
5. CATEGORIZATION: Review and standardize category naming across both catalogs
6. SEO: Consider maintaining original slugs for URL compatibility
7. TESTING: Test product display and functionality after import

RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS
======================
• Large import (233 products) - consider batch processing
• Image URL validation needed - some may be broken
• Price validation recommended - automated pricing may need adjustment
• Category naming consistency between old and new products
• Inventory management setup required for new products

POST-IMPORT TASKS
=================
1. Verify all products imported successfully
2. Add inventory quantities
3. Set up product variants/options if needed
4. Configure shipping rules for new categories
5. Update search/filtering functionality
6. Test checkout process with new products
7. SEO optimization for new product pages

FINAL PRODUCT COUNT AFTER IMPORT
================================
Current Database: 183 products
CSV Import: 233 products
TOTAL CATALOG: 416 products

This represents a significant expansion of the product catalog and should provide
a comprehensive offering across all menswear categories.
