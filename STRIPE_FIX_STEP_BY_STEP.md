## üéØ EXACT Order to Run

### Step 1: Check Current Status (2 min)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: CHECK_STRIPE_STATUS.sql
-- This shows how many products have Stripe IDs
```

### Step 2: Verify Core Products Protected (1 min)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: PROTECTED_CORE_PRODUCTS.sql
-- Run ONLY the SELECT queries (not the UPDATE yet)
-- This lists your July 28 products that we'll keep
```

### Step 3: Clear ONLY New Imports (2 min)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: SAFE_STRIPE_CLEANUP.sql
-- This clears Stripe IDs from August imports ONLY
-- Your core products stay untouched
```

### Step 4: Map New Products to Existing Prices (3 min)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: MAP_NEW_PRODUCTS_TO_EXISTING_PRICES.sql
-- This reuses your existing Stripe price IDs
```

### Step 5: Final Verification (1 min)
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Check everything is mapped:

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN p.created_at < '2025-08-01' THEN 'Core Product'
    ELSE 'New Import'
  END as product_type,
  p.category,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as products,
  COUNT(pv.stripe_price_id) as with_stripe,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(pv.stripe_price_id) as without_stripe
FROM products p
JOIN product_variants pv ON pv.product_id = p.id
WHERE p.status = 'active'
GROUP BY product_type, p.category
ORDER BY product_type, p.category;
```

### Step 6: Handle Missing Prices (If Any)
```sql
-- Check what prices don't have matches:
SELECT DISTINCT
  pv.price / 100.0 as price_usd,
  COUNT(*) as variants_needing_price
FROM product_variants pv
WHERE pv.stripe_price_id IS NULL
GROUP BY pv.price
ORDER BY pv.price;

-- For any missing (like $329.99, $349.99):
-- Option A: Create 2 new prices in Stripe Dashboard
-- Option B: Map to closest existing price
```

### Step 7: Clean Stripe Dashboard (Optional, 5 min)
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
2. Search for "Velvet"
3. Select all duplicate blazers
4. Click "..." ‚Üí "Archive products"
5. Repeat for "Sparkle", "Suspender", etc.

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

After running all steps:

**Core Products (July 28):**
- Premium Business Suits: ‚úÖ Still working
- Ties: ‚úÖ Still working
- Bundles: ‚úÖ Still working
- Shirts: ‚úÖ Still working

**New Imports (August):**
- Velvet Blazers: ‚úÖ Mapped to suit prices
- Tuxedos: ‚úÖ Mapped to suit prices
- Accessories: ‚úÖ Mapped to tie prices

**Stripe Dashboard:**
- Active: ~41 core products
- Archived: 200+ duplicates

## üö® If Something Goes Wrong

### Restore Core Products:
```sql
-- If core products lost their Stripe IDs, restore them:
UPDATE product_variants pv
SET stripe_price_id = 'price_1Rpv2tCHc12x7sCzVvLRto3m'
FROM products p
WHERE p.id = pv.product_id
AND p.name = 'Premium Navy Business Suit'
AND pv.price = 17999;
-- Repeat for other core products
```

### Check What's Not Working:
```sql
-- Find products without Stripe IDs:
SELECT 
  p.name,
  p.category,
  p.created_at,
  COUNT(*) as variants_without_stripe
FROM products p
JOIN product_variants pv ON pv.product_id = p.id
WHERE pv.stripe_price_id IS NULL
GROUP BY p.name, p.category, p.created_at
ORDER BY p.created_at;
```

## üìä Success Metrics

You know it worked when:
1. ‚úÖ All July 28 products still have Stripe IDs
2. ‚úÖ New products are mapped to existing prices
3. ‚úÖ Checkout works for all products
4. ‚úÖ No new Stripe products were created
5. ‚úÖ Stripe dashboard has ~41 active products (not 200+)
