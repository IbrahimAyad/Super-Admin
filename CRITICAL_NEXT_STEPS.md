## What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run Database Migration (2 minutes)

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz/sql

Run this SQL:
```sql
-- Add Stripe fields to products and variants
ALTER TABLE products 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_product_id TEXT UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

ALTER TABLE product_variants
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_price_id TEXT UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS stripe_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Check it worked
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_products,
    COUNT(stripe_product_id) as has_stripe_id
FROM products;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sync Products to Stripe (30-45 minutes)

**Option A: If you give me the keys**
Provide:
- Stripe Secret Key (sk_live_...)
- Supabase Service Role Key

I'll run the sync immediately.

**Option B: Run it yourself**
1. Get your Stripe Secret Key: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Get Supabase Service Role: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz/settings/api
3. Edit `scripts/sync-products-to-stripe.ts` with your keys
4. Run: `npx ts-node scripts/sync-products-to-stripe.ts`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Product Images (After Stripe Sync)

The images are broken because of bucket URL issues. Quick fix:

```sql
-- Fix wrong bucket URLs
UPDATE products 
SET primary_image = REPLACE(
  primary_image, 
  'pub-8ea0502158a94b8ca8a7abb9e18a57e8.r2.dev',
  'pub-5cd8c531c0034986bf6282a223bd0564.r2.dev'
)
WHERE primary_image LIKE '%pub-8ea%';

UPDATE product_images 
SET image_url = REPLACE(
  image_url, 
  'pub-8ea0502158a94b8ca8a7abb9e18a57e8.r2.dev',
  'pub-5cd8c531c0034986bf6282a223bd0564.r2.dev'
)
WHERE image_url LIKE '%pub-8ea%';
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

‚úÖ Webhooks deployed and working
‚úÖ Admin login fixed
‚úÖ Database optimized
‚úÖ Security hardened
‚è≥ Stripe products sync (BLOCKING)
‚è≥ Image URLs fixed (VISUAL ISSUE)
‚úÖ Monitoring configured

## Timeline

- **NOW**: Run database migration (2 min)
- **NEXT**: Start Stripe sync (45 min)
- **WHILE WAITING**: Fix image URLs (5 min)
- **IN 1 HOUR**: Everything working!

## The Bottom Line

Without the Stripe sync, your store is just a catalog - no one can buy anything! This is THE most critical issue. Everything else is working, but this blocks all revenue.

**Need help?** 
- Share the keys and I'll run it
- Or follow the instructions in `RUN_STRIPE_SYNC.md`

Once this is done, your store is 100% ready for production! üöÄ
