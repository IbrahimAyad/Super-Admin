## üìã Phase 1: Critical Revenue Fixes (Week 1)

### 1.1 Complete Stripe Product Sync ‚ö° URGENT
**Objective**: Enable all 274 products to be purchasable

**Current State**:
- 28 products synced to Stripe (10.2% coverage)
- 246 products cannot be purchased
- Stripe sync infrastructure exists but incomplete

**Migration Tasks**:
```bash
# 1. Run bulk Stripe sync
./scripts/sync-products-to-stripe.ts

# 2. Verify sync coverage  
SELECT COUNT(*) as total, 
       COUNT(stripe_product_id) as synced,
       ROUND(COUNT(stripe_product_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 1) as percentage
FROM products;

# 3. Create missing price variants for all sizes
# 4. Test checkout flow for newly synced products
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] 100% of active products have `stripe_product_id`
- [ ] All product variants have `stripe_price_id`
- [ ] Checkout works for all product categories
- [ ] Stripe dashboard shows 274 products

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours (mostly automated)
**Business Impact**: Immediate revenue recovery

### 1.2 Fix Image URL Bucket Mapping ‚ö° URGENT
**Objective**: Fix broken product images (183 products affected)

**Current State**:
- THREE different R2 buckets in use
- Incorrect bucket mapping causing 404 image errors
- 67% of products show placeholder images

**Migration Tasks**:
```sql
-- Fix batch images using wrong bucket
UPDATE products 
SET primary_image = REPLACE(
  primary_image,
  'https://pub-8ea0502158a94b8ca8a7abb9e18a57e8.r2.dev/batch_1/',
  'https://pub-5cd8c531c0034986bf6282a223bd0564.r2.dev/batch_1/'
)
WHERE primary_image LIKE '%pub-8ea0502158a94b8ca8a7abb9e18a57e8.r2.dev/batch_1/%';

-- Fix product_images table
UPDATE product_images 
SET image_url = REPLACE(
  image_url,
  'https://pub-8ea0502158a94b8ca8a7abb9e18a57e8.r2.dev/batch_1/',
  'https://pub-5cd8c531c0034986bf6282a223bd0564.r2.dev/batch_1/'
)
WHERE image_url LIKE '%pub-8ea0502158a94b8ca8a7abb9e18a57e8.r2.dev/batch_1/%';

-- Remove placeholder images where real images exist
-- (Manual verification required)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All `/batch_1/` images use correct bucket URL
- [ ] No products show placeholder when real images exist
- [ ] Image loading success rate >95%
- [ ] Admin panel displays all product images correctly

**Time Estimate**: 2-4 hours
**Business Impact**: Improved customer experience and conversion

## üìã Phase 2: Data Quality Cleanup (Week 2)

### 2.1 Remove Duplicate Products üßπ
**Objective**: Clean up 209+ duplicate products cluttering the database

**Current State**:
- Multiple velvet blazers with identical names but different IDs
- Duplicates created during multiple CSV imports
- Confusing admin panel with duplicate listings

**Migration Strategy**:
```sql
-- Identify duplicates (keep oldest)
WITH duplicates AS (
  SELECT name, MIN(created_at) as keep_date, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM products
  GROUP BY name
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
SELECT p.id, p.name, p.created_at, d.count
FROM products p
INNER JOIN duplicates d ON p.name = d.name
WHERE p.created_at > d.keep_date
ORDER BY d.count DESC, p.name;

-- Delete newer duplicates (after verification)
DELETE FROM products
WHERE id IN (
  -- List of verified duplicate IDs
);
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Each product name appears only once
- [ ] ~150-200 unique products remain (not 274)
- [ ] All Stripe integrations preserved for kept products
- [ ] Admin panel shows clean product listings

**Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours (includes manual verification)
**Business Impact**: Simplified product management

### 2.2 Standardize Product Categories üìä
**Objective**: Fix inconsistent category naming

**Current Issues**:
- "Blazers" vs "Blazer"
- Inconsistent capitalization
- Mixed naming conventions

**Migration Tasks**:
```sql
-- Standardize category names
UPDATE products SET category = 'Luxury Velvet Blazers' 
WHERE category IN ('Velvet Blazers', 'velvet blazers', 'Velvet Blazer');

UPDATE products SET category = 'Men''s Suits'
WHERE category IN ('Suits', 'suits', 'Men Suits');

-- Full category standardization script needed
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Consistent category naming across all products
- [ ] Category filter works properly in admin panel
- [ ] Analytics reports use standardized categories

## üìã Phase 3: Admin Panel Fixes (Week 3)

### 3.1 Fix Product Form Schema Mismatch üîß
**Objective**: Align admin panel forms with actual database schema

**Current Issues**:
- Form expects fields that don't exist in database
- Update operations fail due to schema mismatches
- Complex interfaces not matching simple database structure

**Migration Tasks**:
```typescript
// Simplify ProductForm interface to match database
interface ProductFormData {
  // ‚úÖ Keep (these exist in database)
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  sku: string;
  handle: string; // NOT url_slug
  base_price: number;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'archived';
  is_bundleable: boolean;
  primary_image: string;
  
  // ‚ùå Remove (these don't exist)
  // product_type, materials, care_instructions, 
  // fit_type, occasion, features, meta_title, meta_description
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Product creation form submits successfully
- [ ] Product updates complete without errors
- [ ] Form validation matches database constraints
- [ ] No more "column does not exist" errors

**Time Estimate**: 6-8 hours
**Business Impact**: Functional admin panel for product management

### 3.2 Implement Missing Inventory System üì¶
**Objective**: Add inventory management functionality expected by admin panel

**Current State**:
- Admin panel imports inventory functions but table doesn't exist
- No stock tracking capability
- Variant management incomplete

**Migration Tasks**:
```sql
-- Create inventory table
CREATE TABLE inventory (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  product_variant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES product_variants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  quantity_available INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  quantity_reserved INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  quantity_sold INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  reorder_point INTEGER DEFAULT 5,
  last_restock_date DATE,
  cost_per_unit INTEGER, -- Cost in CENTS
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add inventory tracking to variants
ALTER TABLE product_variants 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS inventory_quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS low_stock_threshold INTEGER DEFAULT 5;

-- Create inventory management functions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_inventory_quantity(
  variant_id UUID,
  quantity_change INTEGER
) RETURNS BOOLEAN;
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Inventory table exists and functions
- [ ] Admin panel inventory management works
- [ ] Stock levels tracked per variant

### Post-Migration Validation
```sql
-- Product system health check
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_products,
  COUNT(stripe_product_id) as stripe_synced,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN primary_image NOT LIKE '%placeholder%' THEN 1 END) as real_images,
  COUNT(DISTINCT category) as categories
FROM products
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Verify no duplicate names
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM products
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check image URL validity
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN primary_image LIKE '%pub-8ea0502158a94b8ca8a7abb9e18a57e8%' THEN 'Bucket 1'
    WHEN primary_image LIKE '%pub-5cd8c531c0034986bf6282a223bd0564%' THEN 'Bucket 2'
    WHEN primary_image LIKE '%placeholder%' THEN 'Placeholder'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END as image_source,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM products
GROUP BY image_source;
```
