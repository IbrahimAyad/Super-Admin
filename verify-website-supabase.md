# üîç Website Image Loading Issue

## The Problem:
- Images are showing in admin panel
- Images NOT showing on website: https://kct-menswear-ai-enhanced.vercel.app
- Products are loading but images are broken

## Possible Causes:

### 1. ‚ùå CORS Issue (Less Likely)
Your CORS already includes `https://kct-menswear-ai-enhanced.vercel.app`

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Different Supabase Instance (Most Likely!)
The website might be using a DIFFERENT Supabase project than the admin panel.

**Admin Panel uses:**
- URL: `https://gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co`
- This is where we updated all the products

**Website might be using:**
- A different Supabase instance
- Check the website's environment variables

## How to Fix:

### Option 1: Check Website's Supabase Config
1. Go to your website's Vercel dashboard
2. Check environment variables for:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
3. Make sure it matches: `https://gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co`

### Option 2: Check Browser Network Tab
1. Open website: https://kct-menswear-ai-enhanced.vercel.app
2. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Network tab
3. Look for Supabase API calls
4. Check which Supabase URL it's calling (look for `.supabase.co`)

### Option 3: Test Direct Image Access
Open this image directly in your browser:
```

```

If it loads directly but not on the website, it's definitely CORS.

## Quick Test:
1. Open the test file: `test-website-cors.html` in your browser
2. See if images load with green borders
3. Check console for any CORS errors

## Most Likely Solution:
The website is probably pulling products from a DIFFERENT Supabase database than where we updated the images. We need to either:
1. Update the website to use the correct Supabase instance
2. Or update products in the Supabase instance the website is using
