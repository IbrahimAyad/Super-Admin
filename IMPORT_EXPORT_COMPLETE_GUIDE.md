## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### If imports fail:
1. Check CSV format matches examples
2. Ensure email (customers) or name (products) is provided
3. Run the SQL functions first

### If exports are empty:
1. Check you have data in the tables
2. Verify database connection

## 📝 **Import Logic**

### Customers:
- Uses email as unique identifier
- Updates if exists, creates if new
- Handles missing fields gracefully

### Products:
- Uses product name to check existence
- Creates variants for each size
- Auto-generates SKUs if not provided
- Converts prices to cents for storage

## 🎉 **Summary**

Your import/export system is **100% complete** with:
- ✅ Full UI implementation
- ✅ Database functions
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Sample test files
- ✅ Real-time feedback

Everything is ready to use!
