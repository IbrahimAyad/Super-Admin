# CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE - SERVICE ROLE KEY REMOVED

## What was changed:
1. **Removed `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from `.env` file** - This key should NEVER be in frontend code or committed to version control.

2. **Updated `.env.example`** - Now includes proper warnings about sensitive keys.

## Action Required:

### For Local Development:
The service role key is NOT needed for local development. The anon key is sufficient for all frontend operations.

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Set the service role key ONLY in Supabase Edge Function secrets:**
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key_here
   ```

2. **Never put these keys in `.env` files:**
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - Any other backend-only secrets

3. **Edge Functions that need the service role key** should access it via:
   ```typescript
   const serviceRoleKey = Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')
   ```

## Security Best Practices:
- Frontend should only use the `anon` key (VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- Service role key should only exist in Edge Function environment
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies to control data access
- Never expose admin operations to the frontend

## Verification:
Run this command to ensure no service role keys are in your codebase:
```bash
grep -r "SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git .
```
