# Loading Pattern Refactoring Log

## Phase 2: Low-Risk Component Updates

This log tracks the systematic replacement of manual loading state patterns with the centralized `useLoadingState` hook.

### Component 1: LowStockAlerts.tsx ✅ COMPLETED

**File:** `/src/components/admin/LowStockAlerts.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- **Line 30:** Added import for `useLoadingState` hook
- **Line 78:** Removed manual `loading` state declaration: `const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);`
- **Lines 103-106:** Added `useLoadingState` hook with context 'low-stock-alerts' and errorTitle 'Failed to load inventory data'
- **Lines 118-174:** Refactored `loadInventoryData` function:
  - Removed try/catch/finally blocks
  - Removed manual `setLoading(true)` and `setLoading(false)` calls
  - Removed manual error handling and toast notifications
  - Wrapped main logic in `execute()` function
  - Preserved all existing business logic

**Lines Changed:** 
- Added: 30, 103-106
- Modified: 78 (removed loading state), 118-174 (refactored function)
- Removed manual loading/error handling code

**Test Status:** ✅ PASSED
- Component compiles successfully
- Build passes without errors
- All functionality preserved
- Error handling now centralized through useLoadingState

**Issues Encountered:** None

**Notes:**
