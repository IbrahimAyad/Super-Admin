# Deployment Troubleshooting

## Issue
The admin dashboard is showing the same errors even after running RLS fixes, suggesting either:
1. The deployment hasn't updated yet
2. There's a caching issue
3. The RLS policies aren't working as expected

## Steps to Verify Latest Deployment

### 1. Check Vercel Deployment
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Look for the latest deployment (should show the commit with our changes)
- The commit message should include "connect UI components to real database data"
- Make sure it shows as "Ready"

### 2. Force Refresh
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Try a different browser

### 3. Check Build Logs
Look for these in the Vercel build logs:
- "3528 modules transformed" (this matches your screenshot)
- References to ProductTest.tsx and StorageTest.tsx (new files)

### 4. Test New Routes
Try accessing these new test pages we created:
- `/product-test` - Should show product schema verification
- `/storage-test` - Should show storage bucket test

If these routes show 404, then the deployment hasn't updated.

### 5. Check Deployment URL
Make sure you're using the latest deployment URL. Each deployment has a unique hash.
Format: `https://backend-ai-enhanced-kct-admin-[HASH]-ibrahimayads-projects.vercel.app`

## Quick Fix Attempts

1. **Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard**
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
   - Choose "Redeploy with existing Build Cache" (faster)

2. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Ensure VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are set
   - These should match what's in your .env file

3. **Direct Database Test**
   Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to confirm policies work:
   ```sql
   -- This should return true if policies are working
   SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 as policies_work FROM products;
   ```
