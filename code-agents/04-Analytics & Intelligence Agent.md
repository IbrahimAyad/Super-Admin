```sql

WITH product_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) as order_count,
    SUM(oi.quantity) as units_sold,
    SUM(oi.line_total) as revenue,
    AVG(oi.line_total/oi.quantity) as avg_price
  FROM products p
  LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
  LEFT JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id
  WHERE o.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY p.id, p.name
)
SELECT * FROM product_metrics
ORDER BY revenue DESC;


AI Recommendation Approach:


// Hybrid recommendation system
const getRecommendations = async (userId: string) => {
  const collaborative = await getCollaborativeRecs(userId);
  const contentBased = await getContentBasedRecs(userId);
  const trending = await getTrendingProducts();
  
  return mergeAndRankRecommendations({
    collaborative: 0.5,
    contentBased: 0.3,
    trending: 0.2
  });
};
