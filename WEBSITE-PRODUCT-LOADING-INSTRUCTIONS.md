# üõçÔ∏è Website Product Loading Instructions

## Current Status
‚úÖ **270 out of 274 products** have working images
‚úÖ All image URLs are now correctly mapped to existing R2 bucket files
‚úÖ Database is properly configured with correct bucket URLs

## To Get Products Loading on Your Website

### 1. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure your website deployment has these environment variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Imd2Y3N3aW1xYXh2eWxneGJrbGJ6Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTM3NjA1MzAsImV4cCI6MjA2OTMzNjUzMH0.UZdiGcJXUV5VYetjWXV26inmbj2yXdiT03Z6t_5Lg24
```

### 2. Update CORS on BOTH R2 Buckets

#### Bucket 1: kct-base-products
1. Go to Cloudflare R2 ‚Üí `kct-base-products` bucket
2. Settings ‚Üí CORS Policy
3. Add your website URL to allowed origins:
```json
{
  "AllowedOrigins": [
    "https://kct-menswear-ai-enhanced.vercel.app",
    "https://kctmenswear.com",
    "https://www.kctmenswear.com",
    "http://localhost:3000"
  ],
  "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
  "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
  "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
}
```

#### Bucket 2: kct-new-website-products
Repeat the same CORS configuration for this bucket.

### 3. Website Code Requirements

Your website should fetch products like this:

```javascript
// Using Supabase client
const { data: products, error } = await supabase
  .from('products')
  .select('*')
  .eq('status', 'active')
  .order('name');

// Products will have primary_image URLs pointing to:
// - https://pub-8ea0502158a94b8ca8a7abb9e18a57e8.r2.dev/ (organized folders)
// - https://pub-5cd8c531c0034986bf6282a223bd0564.r2.dev/ (batch folders)
```

### 4. Image Loading Best Practices

```jsx
// React component example
<img 
  src={product.primary_image}
  alt={product.name}
  loading="lazy"
  onError={(e) => {
    // Fallback to placeholder if image fails
    e.target.src = '/placeholder-product.png';
  }}
/>
```

### 5. Verify Product Data

Run this query in Supabase SQL editor to check your products:

```sql
-- Check product status
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_products,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN primary_image IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_images,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_products
FROM products;

-- Sample active products with images
SELECT name, primary_image, price, status
FROM products
WHERE status = 'active' 
  AND primary_image IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

### 6. Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Images not loading | Check CORS settings on both R2 buckets |
| Products not showing | Verify products have `status = 'active'` |
| Wrong Supabase instance | Check VITE_SUPABASE_URL matches `gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz` |
| Authentication errors | Use anon key for public website, not service role key |

### 7. Test Your Website

1. Open browser developer console (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Load your website
4. Check for:
   - ‚úÖ Successful requests to Supabase API
   - ‚úÖ Images loading from R2 buckets
   - ‚ùå No CORS errors
   - ‚ùå No 404 errors on images

### 8. Products Missing Images

These 4 products still need images assigned:
- Men's Prom Burgundy Paisley Blazer with Matching Bowtie
- Men's Prom Gold Paisley Blazer with Matching Bowtie
- Men's Prom Royal Blue Blazer with Matching Bowtie
- Men's Velvet Purple Blazer with Matching Bowtie

You can either:
1. Upload images to R2 and update these products
2. Set them to `status = 'inactive'` to hide them
3. Assign placeholder images

## Summary

Your product database is ready! Just ensure:
1. ‚úÖ Environment variables are set correctly
2. ‚úÖ CORS is configured on both R2 buckets
3. ‚úÖ Website code fetches from correct Supabase instance
4. ‚úÖ Products are set to 'active' status

The website should now load all 270 products with working images!
